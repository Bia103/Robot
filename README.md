  An oop project in which I made a map and three kinds of robots. The purpose of the game is that each robot will go through the map and reach a final point(each robot can only see a square of 4 cells around him). Each robot has a special ability when they gather items(one of them can jump over obstacles, another one can erase then and the last one can teleport to the nearest slot to the final destination which is not occupied by an obstacle). The program is also simulating the behavior of the robots and part of the gameplay.
